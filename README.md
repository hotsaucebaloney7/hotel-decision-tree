# Assignment 5 - Machine Learning

Advanced Python for Data Science, CIS 454; University of Maine at Augusta, Fall 2021

## Overview 

This repository contains the files necessary to complete Assignment 5, Machine Learning.

In this assignment you will work with Pandas to preprocess a data set and then use that processed data to train a Decision Tree machine learning classifier.   The entire assignment is contained in one Jupyter Notebook. 

## Clone Repository

To work on the assignment you will want to clone this repository to your local computer.   Refer to the instructions from Assignment 1 to review the process.

## Helpful Resources:

- [Pandas Website](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Kaggle Hotel Booking Cancellation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vinayakashastri/hotel-booking-cancellation-dataset?select=hotel_bookings.csv)

## Complete the Notebook

Within the notebook complete the following tasks:    

1. Download and load `hotel_bookings.csv` from Kaggle
2. Use Pandas to explore and preprocess the data.   Idenitfy columns which need preprocessing (conversion of categorial data to numeric vaules, fill empty values, drop columns which are not likely to help with classification)
3. Split the data into training and validation datsets
4. Train a Decision Tree classifier using the training data
5. Predict classifications for the validation data
6. Score the model's accuracy

While not required, extra credit will be available to those who work to tune their model to improve it's accuracy.

As you build out this notebook create lots of cells -- small snippets of code followed or prefaced by comments in "markdown" cells.   A complete solution will be well structured and well documented.

## Rubric

The rubric for this assignment:

- 40 Methodical approahc to preprocessing data is evident
- 30 Decision tree successfully trained and validated
- 20 Appoach is well structured
- 10 Notebook is well documented
- 10 Extra credit points for models which achieve validation accuracy above 85%


## Commit & Push Your work

Once you have completed the assignment, Commit and Push your changes back to your repository.

## Submit to Brightspace

Your completed `Asignment05.ipynb` file should be submitted to Brightspace by the Assignment Due Date.
